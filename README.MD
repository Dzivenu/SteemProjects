# Steem Projects

This is just a demo script for getting current steem power via Steem.js.
The test.js file includes the script to pul the current steem per million vest, 
and then pulls the user account and gives you your total steem power.

This is to help understand how steem power is calculated and how the current steem 
per million vest is calculated.
